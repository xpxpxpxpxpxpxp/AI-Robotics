# Agentic Robot Learning System

This repository introduces a novel architecture for fully agentic, self-discovering robotic learning. Robots autonomously discover their own motion primitives, chain them into skills, and label them semantically with human input and LLM-based expansion.

## Core Features
- Self-discovered motion primitives (no human-defined movements)
- Autonomous skill chaining and evaluation
- Human-in-the-loop natural language labeling
- LLM-based semantic expansion and skill recall

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install ROS 2 and Gazebo.
3. Run primitive discovery simulation.
4. Test chaining and evaluation loops.
5. Start human labeling and language expansion.
